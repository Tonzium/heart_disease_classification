# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a death event due to heart disease in clients based on a comprehensive set of features, including blood values and other questions such as gender, blood_pressure, and smoking habits. Given the critical nature of accurately identifying potential heart disease cases, special attention is devoted to minimizing false negatives, as failing to detect a condition could lead to severe consequences.
